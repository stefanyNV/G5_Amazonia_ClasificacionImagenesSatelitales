Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/performance#python_or_tensor_args and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","[0.48898607 0.02826396 0.1909095  0.01962861 0.03738838 0.9793387\n"," 0.00502494 0.05592987 0.19974682 0.54140645 0.00987041 0.02227315\n"," 0.87168485 0.6969572  0.15610138 0.03851396 0.21355668]\n","['clear', 'habitation', 'primary', 'road']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
